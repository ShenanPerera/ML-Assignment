# Predicting Rainfall for the Next Day Based on Weather Observations in Australia - Machine Learning Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on daily weather observations collected from various locations across Australia.

## Dataset

* **Dataset Name:** Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset
* **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
* **Description:** This dataset comprises approximately 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. It includes features such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind conditions, and cloud cover.
The target variable, RainTomorrow, indicates whether it will rain the next day (Yes or No), making it a binary classification problem.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting next-day rainfall based on the weather features provided in the dataset.

## Models Implemented

This repository includes implementations of the following machine learning models:

1.  **Logistic Regression Model**
2.  **Decision Tree Classifier Model**
3.  **Random Forest Classifier Model**
4.  **AdaBoost CLassifier Model**

Each model is trained, tested, and evaluated to determine its performance on the rain prediction task.
