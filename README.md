# Sleep Disorder Prediction - Machine Learning Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models to predict sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, and No Disorder) based on individuals' health and lifestyle factors. This project utilizes the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset.

## Dataset

* **Dataset Name:** Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset
* **Source:** Kaggle - Sleep Health and Lifestyle
* **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data)
* **Description:** This dataset provides information about people's sleep patterns, health conditions, and lifestyle choices, which is used to predict various sleep disorders.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, and No Disorder) using the features provided in the dataset.

## Models Implemented

This repository includes implementations of the following machine learning models:

1.  **Logistic Regression Model**
2.  **Decision Tree Classifier Model**
3.  **Random Forest Classifier Model**
4.  **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Each of these models is trained, tested, and evaluated to determine its performance on the sleep disorder prediction task.
